# Link Building ROI – How to Measure the Return on Investment Effectively

Understanding the return on investment (ROI) for link building is essential for determining whether it's worth the effort. Calculating the ROI of your link building campaigns enables you to identify the most profitable strategies and keywords. Let’s explore how to effectively measure link building ROI and make data-driven decisions for your SEO strategy.

## Starting with the Right Keyword Set

The foundation of ROI analysis is identifying the keyword set you want to optimize through link building. Crafting a targeted off-page SEO strategy begins with selecting the right keywords. Key parameters to consider include:

- **Search Volume**: Keywords with high search volume are more likely to drive traffic. Tools like Searchmetrics, Sistrix, or SEMRush can help you identify these keywords.
- **Transactional Intent**: Focus on keywords that demonstrate buyer intent, such as “Buy Adidas Original Swift Run,” rather than broader terms like “Adidas Shoes.”
- **High Shopping Cart Value**: Look for keywords associated with large shopping carts or high-margin products. Tools like Google Analytics can provide eCommerce data.
- **Threshold Ranking**: Target keywords that rank between positions #5 and #30 in search engine results, where improvements can yield significant ROI.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Assess whether your competitors for these keywords are beatable with reasonable effort.

By analyzing these metrics, you can prioritize your keyword set and identify which ones offer the most profit potential for link building.

## Evaluating Keyword Profitability

### Option 1: Forecasting Traffic and Sales Growth

Begin by analyzing your current data. For example:

| **Keyword**        | **Search Volume** | **Current Position** |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Stihl Chainsaw      | 16,948            | #5                   |

Using tools like Google Search Console, calculate how many clicks you’re currently receiving at your ranking position. Combine this with data from your analytics platform to determine the sales generated. Next, estimate the ranking improvement potential (e.g., moving from #5 to #3) and calculate the additional traffic and revenue this new position could generate.

### Option 2: AdWords Opportunity Cost

Another way to evaluate ROI is by comparing link building costs to AdWords opportunity costs. Using tools like SEMRush, identify the cost-per-click (CPC) for your targeted keyword. Then, calculate the expenses required to generate the same amount of traffic through paid ads. This method provides a direct comparison of link building and PPC investment efficiency.

## Limitations of ROI Calculations in SEO

When estimating ROI, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties. For example:

- **SEO Tools Inaccuracy**: Forecasted click rates or search volumes may vary from actual results.
- **Conversion Seasonality**: External factors, such as seasonal trends, can affect conversion rates. For example, sales for products like chainsaws may fluctuate depending on pruning seasons.
- **Google’s Algorithms**: Search engine behavior, such as delayed indexing or ranking updates, can impact the effectiveness of your campaigns.

Despite these uncertainties, making informed assumptions based on historical data and experience will help guide your strategy effectively.
